The Robocube has been designed from 1997-2000 at the <A href="http://arti.vub.ac.be"> VUB AI Lab</A> by Dr. Thomas Walle <br>
It is currently used by some research groups including the <A href="http://www.rids.de"> RIDS (Roboter in der Schule) project</a> and the <A href="http://robotics.iu-bremen.de"> IUB Robotics group</A><br>

<td VALIGN=TOP>One main goal of the architecture is to allow the on-board
implementation of as many robot behaviors as possible. Therefore, RoboCube
provides quite some computation power and memory within the space-constraints.
In addition, RoboCube is layed out to deal with various sensors and motors,
radio-communication, and the option of high-resolution on-board vision.

<h3>
Main features</h3>

<ul>
<li>
open bus architecture</li>

<li>
MC68332 CPU running at 16MHz</li>

<li>
256kB SRAM main memory</li>

<li>
128kB EPROM</li>

<li>
24 analog/digital (A/D) converter,</li>

<li>
6 digital/analog (D/A) converter,</li>

<li>
16 binary Input/Output (binI/O),</li>

<li>
5 binary Inputs,</li>

<li>
10 timer channels (TPC),</li>

<li>
3 DC-motor controller with pulse-accumulation (PAC), and</li>

<li>
an intelligent active InfraRed (aIR) subsystem.</li>
</ul>
An important aspect is that RoboCube's onboard software core supports an
easy handling of these ports in combination with common sensors and motors.
This means that it is possible to PlugAndPlay various components, which
can be accessed in a high-level manner in software. RoboCube runs the <i>Process
Description Language</i> (PDL) which combines C with special constructs
facilitating behavioral control through networks of dynamical processes.

<h3>
RoboCube Version 2.0</h3>
Currently, we are working on a new version of the RoboCube platform. New
features include:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<a href="bdm/bdm-gal.html">BDM interface</a></li>

<li>
<a href="extbus/bustim.html">Embedding
of DUART and I2C</a></li>

<li>
<!A HREF="fpdram/fpdram.html">DRAM and FPU extension</li>
</ul>
Whereas the BDM interface allows for a much better debugging, it also serves
as a facility to program the now available Flash-EPROM from scratch. To
do so, we developped a simple linux tool, called the BDM monitor to perform
simple debugging tasks like e.g. reading processor status, reading and
writing memory locations, downloading S-record files and last but not least
programming and erasing our flash EPROMs. All source files are freely available
<a href="bdmmon.tgz">here</a>.&nbsp;
<p>The embedding of the DUART and the two I2C busmaster chips allows a
much higher CPU frequency, i.e. 25MHz. Additionally, 16 direct memory mapped
binary outputs could be inserted.&nbsp;
<p>On top of that, an additional board was designed. It hosts a MC68882
FPU chip running at 25MHz and implements 16MB of DRAM. Since the whole
physical address space is 16MB, only 13MB are accessible.&nbsp;
<p>Again, the pdf sources of the used components can be retrieved <a href="pdf2.html">here</a>
and the schematics can be seen <a href="schematics2.html">here</a>.</td>
