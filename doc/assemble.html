The baords are delivered without any connector. In the picture below

In a next step you press the stacking connector through the
holes. Every pin has a sharp edge which cuts into the plating of the
hole in the board. As you can see in the picture below the pins of the
connector looking out of the board as flag poles.

In order to shield the pins of the connector a housing receptacle is
pressed from above on the board. Again, the sharp edges of the pins
cut into the plastic of the receptacle forming a very stable
connection.

After completing the other side you get the final board. In the left
picture you can see the board from above and in the right picture from

Thus, in assembling the connectors yourself, it is up to the
respective needs in which row
the system is stacked and how many boards are finally integrated.
