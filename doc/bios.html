<H2>The RoboCube's Basic Input/Output Operating System (BIOS)</H2>

RoboCube's BIOS has a quite special design
to address the specific needs for robotic control.
Besides the usual BIOS functionality like serial I/O for
program download and debugging,
it provides the following additional core functions:

<UL>
<LI> Access to sensors and actuators</LI>
<LI> Wireless communication interface management</LI>
</UL>

To have a simplified and uniform access to the different actuators and
sensors, the BIOS regularly reads the sensors, preprocesses the sensor data
and stores the results in its RAM. The actual application program 
has to perform only read
operations on the main memory. Since the
actual read/write operations to the hardware are triggered by a 
timer interrupt every few milliseconds, sensors are read out in well-defined
synchronized time
intervals. This is especially important for reading out pulse
accumulators to get well-defined results. The actuators are updated by this
timer interrupt as well. Therefore, the application program can schedule
sensor updates to be executed by the next timer interrupt.
<P>

The wireless communication interface provides reliable radio communication
between several parties. Each party is identified by a unique number (ID).
The data is transmitted in packets, which can be directed to only one other
party (unicast), several other parties (multicast) or all other parties
(broadcast). 
Besides the payload data, these packets
contain the ID of the source and the IDs of the destinations as well as
packet sequence numbers and information for a cyclic redundancy check (CRC).
<P>

The radio communication protocol provides two communication channels, one for
reliable stream communication and one for unreliable direct communication.
The reliable stream communication channel provides automatic retransmission
of lost packets and proper packet reordering on reception.
Packets are CRC-checked upon reception and are discarded, if the CRC-check
fails.
Each packet in the reliable stream communication channel has to be
acknowledged, non-acknowledged packets are assumed to be lost and will be 
resent after a timeout. 
<P>

To prevent packet collisions, the protocol uses two strategies, 
token passing and Carrier Sensed Multiple Access (CSMA).
Each ID has its own time slot for transmission, and each party tries to
identify its proper timeslot by listening to packets from other parties,
identifying their IDs and synchronizing the protocol's time slots. Then the
party waits for its own timeslot. But
before transmission really starts, the presence of a carrier is checked. If no
carrier is present, then the party starts to transmit. If, however, the
transmission gets interrupted by another party, a CRC mismatch will occur and
the packet is discarded upon reception. The receiving party will not
acknowledge that packet and the packet will be resent.
<P>

If a packet-acknowledge is lost, the sender will send the well-received
packet again, but the recipient will discard the packet because a packet with
the same packet sequence number has already been received. 
<P>

The wireless communication interface has its own UART and interrupt service
routine, therefore the communication is hidden from the application program,
it only has to empty the receive queue from time to time. 
<P>

On the hardware side, the wireless communication interface is implemented with
a Radiometrix Bim433-F UHF Transceiver directly connected to the UART. 
This low power device can transmit half-duplex serial data with 40kBit/s over
about 30m and provides on-board carrier detection and signal decoding circuits.
