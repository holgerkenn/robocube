General control</A>
</H1>

<P>
The problem of the externel devices consists in the possibly very long
disable time of the data acknowledge signal (DSACK) and the data bus for
read accesses. Furthermore, the DUART has a very long hold time for the
data in a write access.

<P>
To overcome this, we insert a bidirectional driver with internal registers
into the data bus. Each port of the driver is controlled by 3 signals:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>SRCSEL</STRONG>
<DD>selects from source the output is fed -- the internal
register for this direction or the other port
<DT><STRONG>CLK</STRONG>
<DD>clocks data from the other port into the internal register
<DT><STRONG>/OE</STRONG>
<DD>output enable for the port
</DL>
<P>
The CPU side port is activated for read accesses by /RDOE. Basically, 
it runs with the according chip select.

<P>
A direct write after an read access to some external bus master would
due to the large disable time conflict with the still driving master
and cause bus contention. But luckily there has to be a fetch after
the access and in the meantime the external bus has disabled its data
bus interface. Even for fast loops, where there is no fetching, the
next cycle is completely internal (update and test internal counter).

<P>
In write cycles the chip select is enabled as early as the data strobe
(/DS). Since the computation of the /WROE takes some time and the
external bus controller expects valid data with the chip select going
low, we enable the data bus driver with the write signal (/RW), that
is valid after the first half clock cycle of the access. Consequently,
in every write cycle the data bus driver is enabled. To ensure the
large hold time specification of the DUART the /WROE signal is
registered. Since the RW signal changes its state as early as in the
first clock cycle of the next bus cycle, the data port is still active
one clock cycle after the write access. To deliver valid data as long
as possible, the port's source is switched to the internal register
with the negated /AS signal. Thus, data is valid early in the
beginning of the write cycle and gets invalid when the next read cycle
starts.

<P>
The data acknowledge signal is handled in the same way as the data bus is.
Since it is unidirectional, the driver is implemented in the GAL.
The computattion of the enable signal needs to cover several cases and
thus, the logic equation contains some 'or'. But the GAL offers only
one term. Consequently, a seperate output is used for its computation.

<P>
A second issue is the interupt acknowledge cycle. It is basically a read
cycle, but there is no chip select set. Hence, the cycle has to be decoded
by the GAL. Such a cycle is recognized by the two low order function code
bits (FC1, FC0) beeing 1 and address bit A0 beeing 1 as well. Address bits
A1,...,A3 give the interupt level. This is sufficient because the lowest
address bit distinguishes between other CPU space cycles. Due to lack
of input pins A0 is not decoded. In selecting only unequal interupt
levels, i.e. A1 is always 1 in this case, this distinguishes the
interupt acknowledge cycles for these devices from other CPU cycles.

<P>
Finally, the resulting equations for the GAL.

<P><PRE>
GAL22V10

CK EQ RW /AS FC1 FC0 A3 A2 A1 /CS5 /CS2 GND
/CS1 /DACKI DACKOE /IACK1 /IACK3 /IACK5 RDOE /WROE WRCK /REGCE /DACKO VCC


RDOE = (/CS1 + /CS2 + /CS5)*RW + /IACK1 + /IACK3 + IACK5;

/IACK1 = /AS*RW*FC1*FC0*/A3*/A2*A1;    //IRQ1 --&gt; I2CB
/IACK3 = /AS*RW*FC1*FC0*/A3*A2*A1;     //IRQ3 --&gt; I2CA
/IACK5 = /AS*RW*FC1*FC0*A3*/A2*A1;     //IRQ5 --&gt; DUART

/WROE := /RW;

WRCK = (CS1 + CS2 + CS5)*/RW;

DACKOE = /CS1 + /CS2 + /CS5 + /IACK1 + /IACK3 + /IACK5;
/DACKO.OE = DACKOE;
/DACKO = /DACKI;

//----------------------------------------------------------

/REGCE := /AS*/RW*/FC1*FC0*EQ*REGCE    //on with adr valid and /AS
       +     /RW*/FC1*FC0*EQ*/REGCE;   //off with read or adr invalid
</PRE>
<P>
In the lower part of the definition of the GAL-equations the clock enable
for the binary output is given. The register is clocked with the /DS signal.
The clock is enabled after recognition of a valid address and an active
address strobe (/AS). It is disabled again when the address gets invalid or
the next read cycle starts. This is certainly before the next clock.

<P>
The GAL registers are automatically reset after during power up. Thus, the
write enable of the data bus driver and the clock enable of the binary
output register are both invalid.
